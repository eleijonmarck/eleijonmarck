    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      I'm a software engineer and technical founder focused on building data systems and ML infrastructure. My work spans from low-level systems programming to high-level machine learning applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      I found my passion during my studies and have since dived deep into ML/AI, data processing optimization, and systems programming. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of performance and correctness — exploring languages like Rust that make both possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      My journey has taken me through various domains: from building ML models for music genre classification to exploring the security implications of compile-time code execution in Rust. I enjoy working on problems that require both technical depth and practical application.
    </p>
    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hack for Sweden 2018 Winner</strong> — Built an ML-powered job matching platform combining personality testing with company culture analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Tony Robbins Mastery University 2020</strong> — Focused on lifelong learning and personal development</li>
    </ul>
