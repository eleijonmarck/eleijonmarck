    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      I'm a builder at heart. I work on distributed systems at Grafana, where I specialize in Identity and Access Management (IAM) — building the authorization layer that powers how users, teams, and services interact securely at scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      My role centers on infrastructure that operates at the intersection of security, performance, and developer experience. I've led projects like service accounts for Amazon Managed Grafana, designed anonymous access control for public dashboards, and built Grafana's authorization engine based on Google's Zanzibar paper using OpenFGA.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Build</h2>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about AI applications for developer productivity. I led development of an LLM-powered agent integrated with GitHub to accelerate on-call triage and issue investigation — bringing machine learning into the day-to-day engineering workflow.
    </p>

    <p>
      I contribute ~70% of my time to open source, actively working on OpenFGA and CNCF projects. I believe the best software is scalable, secure, and community-driven.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Before Grafana, I built data infrastructure at Anyfin, worked on big data analytics for aviation at Enplore, and led data streaming teams at Scania. My journey has taken me from ML research (energy disaggregation, music genre classification) to production systems engineering. I hold a Master's in Applied and Computational Mathematics from KTH.
    </p>
    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hack for Sweden 2018 Winner</strong> — Built an ML-powered job matching platform combining personality testing with company culture analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Tony Robbins Mastery University 2020</strong> — Focused on lifelong learning and personal development</li>
    </ul>
