    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      <p>
        I'm a philosopher/tech/happy guy at heart. I love data-driven innovation
        or rather data-informed businesses. My passion is to explore data and
        understand the meaning of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found my passion during my studies and I have since then dived deep
        into the world of ML/AI, optimization of data-processing or the trenches
        of UNIX "everything as a file" to this day. Might put some time for vim
        configuration (way too much time at times) ;)
