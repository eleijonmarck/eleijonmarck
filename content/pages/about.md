I'm a philosopher/tech/happy guy at heart. I love data-driven innovation or rather data-informed businesses. My passion is to explore data and understand the meaning of it.

I found my passion during my studies and I have since then dived deep into the world of ML/AI, optimization of data-processing or the trenches of UNIX "everything as a file" to this day. Might put some time for vim configuration (way too much time at times) ;)
